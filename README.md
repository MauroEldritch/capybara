# Capybara

Capybara is a collection of C2 servers based on different apps and platforms. It was featured at DEFCON 29's Adversary Village.

## Installation

Note: Some C2 servers require additional API keys from different platforms. Check each server's header comments which indicate how to address this.

Simply run the `bundle` command to install required gems, generate and populate API keys where required and you're good to go. 

A dockerized lab is provided for testing purposes.
